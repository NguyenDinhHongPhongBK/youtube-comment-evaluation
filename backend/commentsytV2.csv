Combine IQ of people in comments is so low that cannot be calculated.
Ukraine are only thinking of themselves
"Today Assad, tomorrow Putin."
"Russia has been on Ukrainian territory committing war crimes for ten years. 
Every single member of the United Nations should be helping Ukraine."
Ukrain✊👍
Zelensky dares putin.....not Ukraine....his term limit expired he ain't president
russia is a looser of this war
Gukesh D is the new FIDE world chess champion 🏆
Other countries are paying Ukraine to have a war with Russia.
Just get it over with already. The American people are tired of Ukraine and Zelenskyy BS. Russia please show them who is boss.
Well this time is real ...
"ahahah  mauvaise cible , go i on Moscoo"
Why is it ok for Russia to launch missiles into civilians in Ukraine but when Ukraine fires back its a 'provocation'.  If India was attacked you would expect to defend  your country would you not ? Russia started the war and can end it any time.
"What we learn from this is that russia does not have any air defence, at least within range of the atacms."
Deep state want ww3
Zelensky will be living in America 2025 to avoid his assassination by his own people.
GO RUSSIA! biden just giving american money away to keep the heat off of himself.
"Then when Oreshnik hits, you'll hear them cry how evil Russia is."
These are field testing at the cost of ukraine
"This soap opera is getting old.  Same old news.  Wondering if its just recycled from a year ago.  Ukrainian sends drones,
Putin issues warning, NATO says something, Russia sends missiles into Ukrainian territory.  Putin issues warning #7,538.  Ukrainian drones do something somewhere.  NATO says something else.  Putin fires back....
Really is this all there is?"
"Great. Now we are waiting for Russia's response.
I wouldn't like to live in Ukraine these days..."
The same attack what Oekraïne did with a Dutch airplane😡
"Ukrain is becoming more stupid everyday. 
Well, what do we expect from a puppet?😂"
January 20 can’t come fast enough
Don’t cry when Russia hit u
Nothing but bots and trash in these comments.

"Big mistake, Putin is going to attack the US soon."
"Russia wants to be a big player, invades sovereign countries, cries when NATO expands as a result, threatens nuclear countries with nuclear strikes - the epitome of geo-political stupidity. All those who support Russia's plight are just as such."
"Честно говоря, американский вариант, по сути, худший из возможных, но нет страны лучше других. Учитывая, какой он человек, он есть и всегда будет чего-то жадным...!!! Ну а святость - это, к сожалению, очень редкое явление, крайне редкое и это очень жаль!!! Дело в том, чтобы понять это, люди всегда будут жадными, снова и снова!!!!!! Но они должны стать святыми. У Америки есть причина, и она стремится иметь больше денег, помогает в различных гуманитарных вопросах и многом другом. Войны велись по разным причинам, в том числе из-за ограничения гибели мирного населения. То, что делали СССР и РФ, имперские устремления, финансовые выгоды и прочее, то же самое, что и в США. Но есть ""БОЛЬШАЯ РАЗНИЦА"" Правительство США действительно убивал мирных жителей, но чем меньше жертв, тем лучше, и в СССР и РФ это работало и продолжает это делать, чем больше мирных жителей убивали, тем лучше. Следует помнить, что когда на Японию были сброшены две атомные бомбы, Япония объявила войну, и бои между японскими солдатами и американскими солдатами были настолько трудными и жестокими, что уровень смертности американских солдат был определенно слишком высок, что правительство США решило сбросить одну атомную бомбу. атомная бомба, которую создало правительство Японии, мы все еще ведем жестокую войну!!!!!! Смертность американских солдат останется высокой, и будет принято решение снова бомбить Японию. А что думают президент РФ и Кремль? Невозможно думать, что они должны ограничить смертность мирного населения: чем больше мирных жителей они убьют, тем лучше для Кремля и президента. Так что при определенных обстоятельствах они были бы очень рады сбросить на Украину 10 атомных бомб, а может и больше, если бы здесь была зона, участок гражданского населения, не важно, Кремль решил бы убить все гражданские лица. Именно поэтому Мария Фатимская Богоматерь (1917 г.) говорила об ошибках России, но это передается из поколения в поколение, так же неправа будет и Российская Федерация через 100 лет. И что значит, что РФ является одной из стран-лидеров по количеству самоубийств??? Лично у меня СССР и РФ ассоциируются со ""СМЕРТЬЮ"". А091"
Now after Russia's retaliation they'll cry.
USA government is a problem and they want to burn the entire world down because they are losing power
Putin is No Saint but it’s NATO that’s Destroyed Ukraine 🇺🇦 Zelenskyy is an Idiot Allowing NATO into Ukraine from Beginning
Ukrainians are doing everything possible to prevent the war from ending. More war means more money. Money from taxpayers and workers. We are fed up with Ukraine and the Ukrainians and their lies.
When you hire a clown you expect jokes. And the joke is on the Ukarine people.
Lot of armchair warriors here
Seems like they're in for a white Christmas.
War crimenals Biden and KAMALA and Blinken and Obama and Nuland and the killers CIA and MI6 and Mossad and there puppets EU and coca junkie zelenski and pedo frind Stamer and there bos psycho killer Natanyahu and Black Rock and Soros are Devils
Maybe putin needs to get oug of Ukraine it there illegally Putin is the Aggressor here Ukraine is defeating its country from a fascist dictator as everyone forhet who Puyin really is  he speaks as a ex KGB agent .
"NATO is making it look like it's an attack from Ukraine.but the truth is,NATO is the one responsible for it"
Their pupet un syria is now is gone..they widraw thiet millitary assist thier..like iran..they are weak..
The russian economy is in brinks of collapse..they are weakend
Am waiting for orenshk response
Nuclear power'namaste
"Since the Ukrainians do not tell Russia whether those are nuclear warheads, Russia will naturally be uneasy if the thing will blow Putin to kingdom come.  
Then it will be too late."
"""Ukraine"" haha you mean the Vassal State of the USA, check yourself before you wreck yourself."
Russia has benn losing its geopolitical capabilities
It's the US firing missiles. Each NATO country fires its own missiles supplied to the corrupt Ukraine.
Zelensky is so DUMB
⁉️⁉️⁉️⁉️⁉️⁉️🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬
USA provocations
""" You Don't spit into the wind , you don't pull the mask off the ol' Lone Ranger and you don't mess around with Jim "" - Jim Croce ... Ukraine is spitting into the wind . It's gonna hit them right back in the face ."

I just pray for yet more restraint from Russia not to meet this irrational toddler like behaviour by Ukraine and its allies. You can be forgiven to think they actually want more fighting. This is stupidity at best... What's the end goal of this? They habe already lost the war.
"Its not ukraine,  its  jewnited states"
Putin is a patient man.
Russia is a paper tiger
Lmfao 😂😂😂 Weak Putin is a loser
Zhelensky never going to change. His criminal mind killing Ukraine people.
Pres. Zelensky seeking peace with Russia then firing missile😂 hit and run😂
Russia is all talk. Russia is finished. Only a matter of time before Russia surrenders.
Ask for Oreshnik and you shall receive in plenty - Elensky 😂
They could still take back chimera
We haven't seen the capabilities of russia in a war. Russia is suppressing for a reason.
This all will end if people start respecting their own country borders and try not to encroaching in neighbors territories.
Waisting good ammunition all because you’re having a temper tantrum because you’re losing. Ukraine literally have no plan to win their just doing shit out of spite
Lmao Russia launched missiles without a war head into Ukraine just to show who is more capable if they do.
Just stop dam u joe Biden dam u .
Am I the only one who is waiting for the Russian response? 😂
Putin is about to fall
Why is Russia mad if they did no damage 😂😂😂😅😅😅😊
"The US government should know now that it is in direct war with Russia. The US weapons, the US experts are doing the work just in the name of Ukraine. The one who can't think this is only the US and its allies."
This is stupid. We need Trump in office to end this before it continues to escalate and sets the world on fire.
Russia has right to defend it self.
"Diverted using electronic warfare,... why are we not getting a full explanation on this? Can Russia hack these missiles? If so what change to warfront can they bring? Someone refer me to an indepth video"
Yo Putin you are looking like a failure to the world  and younneed to up the ante!
And why?
Putin is too weak that's why this war is going on for too long. If Medevev was President this war would have been ended a very long time ago.
Deep into Russian territory?
Russia is sleeping or at best sleepwalking......😢
POOTIN can take a running jump - why should only he be able to use long range rockets. The man is obviously deluded !!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"Maybe the West have reason, putin  draws another red line after the previous is crossed, Russia has shovels instead of nukes."
"Now thats really really really gonna hurt Russia...Pleeeease!
Im starting to think Ukraine wants Russia to try out its new weapons.
This nonsense is like hitting a full grown Brown Bear with a slingshot wielded by a 4 year old....
Repent & turn to Jesus while there is still time."
When will Ukraine 🇺🇦 learn the Can't win 😂😂😂
What a shame for russia anyone can launch missile in their territory and they just give warnings nothing else.
Zilly boy brace yourself
"The more I hear the name Zelensky, the more I love Putin ❤❤ this clown should be sent to where he belongs, a circus 🎉🎉🎉"
Wow.. 😉
It seems more obvious  by now that zelinski  is in contact  with Abaddon
scapegoat.ukraine cant shoot long range without atacms without usa operator and nato satelite guide
Orshnik plenty in russia dont worry
Wait for the after effect the begger would be on the circus show again
The flying suns will be shaking the earth again smh
The faint kindling of war war 3 started  in 2016 when Harambe was taken from us.
"Watch the ""movie no remorse""n u will hear the real reason..."
Oreshinik is about to do some Oreshinik things💪
so how will this help them...considering that nothing works in their favour regardless?????
1.5 million/piece. Ukraine fired 6. 6×1.5 million = 9 million. Damn!
"""Ukraine Fires US Missiles Deep Into Russian Territory"" . It would be honest to say that the ""US launch missiles on Russian territory on behalf of Ukraine who is unable to be able to do it""."
Russia will be in the deep trouble 😈
Let them wait for the answer from Russia
Your spend the money as if the money are yours?
What’s Putrid going to do? Take away Ukrainian’s birthdays?
Zelensky & NATO Stupidity
"No, Vladimir it's already a retaliation on your missile you used yesterday."
Not Ukraine but those who created that mess by putting a crook puppet like Zelensky in charge of that country.
See the Russian response in a couple of days.
I believe Kyiv is going to be in real trouble now. So long. 🤦🏻‍♂️
$9million wasted American tax dollars. Poof! Just that quick.
If there is peace one day it will be despite Zelensky's efforts
It's a way of them seeing if they can intercept the Russian missile
Check the news tomorrow. Ukraine will pay big time for that…
Where will the Orshenik hit now? I guess the little green tshirt is safe under the ground
Unfair Russia has unlimited attacks
Zelensky will run with his suitcases of cash & leave a country he has never cared for to suffer for his infamy.
Stupid NATO
Americans fired those missiles. Ukraine is not security cleared to operate them or trained to operate them. Oreshanik is more effective at Mach 11 and with far more reach.
The Deep State and Biden administration are doing their best to start WW3 before Trump takes office.
"I am from English Indiana, in the USA and I agree with Russia and Putin. I have watched my birth country, murder millions of humans, directly and indirectly. 9/11/2001, was an inside job, it had nothing to do with Osama Bin Laden, Al Zawahiri, Afghanistan, or Iraq. Both of the wars, were illegal wars, the Iraq war alone, killed over a Million Innocent Civilians, within the first 10 months, of the war."
All right Ukraine are you just being stupid or plain stupid why don't you drop it and stop 🛑🛑🛑
American imperialism drives all hostilities worldwide....
"Ahora. Si ay que darles  duro  putin 
Estos.  A todas Las  partes"
Russia did not understand. Zelentsky wants to die in the hands of Russian. He is so tired of taking drugs given by his NATO friends.
So USA launched the missiles using Ukraine.
"its Nato, not ukrainians"
Why mention type of weapons used.. Wion never mentions type of weapons used by Russia..
SLAVA Ukraine 🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦
"Zelenskyy reminds me of Fidel Castro of Cuba 🇨🇺 during the Cuban middle crisis , willingly put his Country as a chess piece to start WW3  . 🧐"
"You are being ruled by Zelensky a puppet of the America,UK,and EU.for profit and the break up for his resources.Zelensky would burn down his nation to rule the ashes."
"UKRAINE IS STILL TRYING HARD TO PROVOKE A NUCLEAR WAR IN THE WORLD SO THAT WE PERISH, BUT BY THE GRACE OF GOD THEY WILL FAIL. BLESSED BE GOD FOREVER🙏🙏🙏"
"Get it straight , Ukraine can not launch anything that needs a sattelite . The US supplies , targets , launches , guides and strikes inside Russia , it is 100% the United States ! Wake up !"
These are Jewish European that are pushing the orthodox Russian church.
Russia c has given enough warnings n sound like hollow threats😂😂😂if u keep warning n no action you are seen to be weak Mr n Putin😂😂
They are testimg their systems.... this is not an attack
GET A BETTER PRESENTER ....
Putin isn't going to do anything about it but talk maybe threaten another missle strike but that's about it
Comme d'habitude le journaliste Goebbels ne laisse pas parler la personne qui était sur place car elle ne raconte pas ce qu'il veut entendre. C'est ça la dictature de la pensée de LCI.
We must stop funding Ukraine. Zelensky does not care of he starts world war three
More money to Ukraine 🇺🇦
US or UK is gonna make Russia go hard on Ukraine. This countries barely care about Ukraine.
"Urals where all heavy military production is concentrated is 4000km away. The strike is less than 200km. Thats not 'deep', just an angry old demented man in US lashing out while he still can."
Who is Ukraine president?
Inconsequential strikes
Will be...big answer
Russia is allowed send  all its bomb to Ukraine while Ukrainr not allowed?😂😂Is putler Joking?😅😅Typical communist ideology bully and cowards😅😅
"Some people never learn, apparently. Russia's answer will arrive shortly. Unfortunately it's regular people who always pay the price."
Looks like more oreshiniks to be deployed
Joe Biden is mentally ill and the CIA is trying to start WWlll before Trump gets in . Blinken and Austin are Raytheon execs and need to see jail time .
All power to Putin Russia
"Location and code, launch activation, everything is given by US. Then only Ukraine can use this missiles. We are not idiots. What happened in Syria, that also we know"
Usa industrial military complex n military nato want to examine more the Russian new  missile so they asked the comedian to provoke the Russians so they send for him a second one...
Ukraine is desperate and they really want Russian to respond so can nato get in and save poppet selesnky from power and he is not even a president..
Ok then soon or later Oresnik will speak for themselves 🤣😂
This is NATO not Ukraine
Biden really hates Trump and is doing everything to bring WWIII before his term is up.
1.5 million dollars for a single damn rocket 😮
Desperate little country. Trump obviously told the tee-shirt fella to take a hike. So he ran to Blinky and asked for more strikes in Russia.
"Not Oooookraine,it is the US poking the bear."
They try but Ukraine can’t do anything with Russia
This clown doesn't want peace... Hopefully Trump will stop the support for Ukraine
"Those long range missiles are not shot by him , they are shot by America they need codes and satellites guidance"
We are getting closer to breaking point
"We know that these missiles can only be directed to be fired by US personnel. This has been stated many times. Washington is really trying to make a mess before Trump gets into the Whitehouse.  This seems totally irrational behaviour to expend 9 million dollars for just a gesture to irritate Russia and bring USA into the conflict. 
Zelensky has no regard for the families of Ukraine. It seems Russia has more concern because this was all about the treatment of Russian speaking people in Ukraine."
Russia will respond with orehesnik.
India has a war chest full of bunk military hardware from Russia.
Update the ukrainian map
Oh no good by Ukraine an friends
Ukraine just destroyed itself
"Not Ukraine, VS BIDEN VS deepstate."
​​With Israel/USA/TURKEY UNPROVOKED Invasion of Syria the WEST has Nothing to say about Russia in Ukraine
"This is the reason Ukraine can not be in NATO, nor will they have any weapons of mass destruction. All aids must be stopped. They are trigger happy. They are too dangerous for peace and stability"
"This can not happen without the direct assistance of US personal.  WHY are We the People accepting this type of behavior from our politicians?  The world will be much safer when it realizes that neocons, the CIA, Zelensky, Nato, and the EU are the true enemies for Peace."
We're on the eve of destruction
US taxpayer money
The end is near!   😔🤷😔🤷🙁
"Russia is too weak to use it,s power"
Dont cry tomorrow😂
Zelensky doesn't like Ukraine.
"I think that Zelensky is desparate, especially after his meeting with Trump.  I think he is trying to stir the hornets nest to try to suck Trump into a conflict that he wants to see as finished."
The Stupidity in Western ignorance is manifesting boldly right in front of our eyes. I feel for Ukrainian people. They don't want this.
So stupid. Stop escalating!!
"What is Ukraine's end goal with all these provocations and escalations? In war, you need to have a plan."
"Ukraine 💙
Defensor Fortis!"

"The consequence of a Russian 🇷🇺 win in his invasion is too great.
It would encourage other large countries, like China 🇨🇳, to try absorbing their neighbours such as Taiwan, Tibet, Inner Mongolia, and East Turkistan into China."
